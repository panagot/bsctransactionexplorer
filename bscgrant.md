## Project Details

### Problem
Current BSC explorers show raw blockchain data that's overwhelming and technical. New users struggle to understand what their transactions actually do, creating a barrier to ecosystem adoption. Existing tools like BSCScan require blockchain expertise to interpret, limiting accessibility for the average user.

### Solution
We built BSC Explorer (https://github.com/panagot/bsctransactionexplorer) to make BSC transactions easy to read and understand for everyone. Our platform:

• Translates complex transaction data into plain English explanations
• Provides visual transaction flows with step-by-step breakdowns
• Recognizes 50+ BSC protocols (PancakeSwap, Venus, Alpaca, etc.)
• Detects MEV attacks and provides security insights
• Offers educational content and pro tips for users
• Features professional UI with dark mode and mobile responsiveness

### Impact
By making BSC transactions accessible to everyone, we're removing barriers to ecosystem adoption and helping onboard new users who can confidently understand their blockchain activity.
